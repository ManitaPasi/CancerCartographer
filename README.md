# CancerCartographer

## 📌 Introduction

This repository provides a simplified approach to classifying and visualizing breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant using the RandomForest classifier. The script `breast_cancer_classification_visualization.py` offers a concise implementation and visual insights on the dataset and results.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset. It's a built-in dataset within the `scikit-learn` library.

## 🛠 Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following packages installed:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `seaborn`

Install them using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn
```

## 🔍 Usage

To run the breast cancer classification and visualization:

```bash
python breast_cancer_classification_visualization.py
```

## 📈 Results

After running the script, you'll be provided with the classification accuracy on the test dataset and a visualization offering insights on the distribution of benign and malignant tumors based on various features.
